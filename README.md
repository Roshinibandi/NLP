# Textual Anomaly Detection in Financial Reports-Documentation
## Introduction
Welcome to the project, "Textual Anomaly Detection in Financial Reports. This project utilizes advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automate the detection of textual anomalies in financial reports, enhancing accuracy and efficiency in identifying potential fraud or errors. By applying NLP methods for preprocessing, feature extraction, and anomaly detection model development, the system ensures data integrity and transparency in financial analysis. Leveraging Python programming and machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, we conduct experiments with diverse datasets to refine anomaly detection algorithms. Through experimentation and validation, we aim to deliver robust anomaly detection models capable of accurately identifying irregularities in financial text data.
## Project Overview
This project aims to automate the detection of textual anomalies in financial reports using advanced NLP techniques. By leveraging NLP, it enhances accuracy in anomaly detection, aiding financial analysts and auditors in identifying potential fraud or errors. The project addresses the critical need for accurate anomaly detection in financial reports, contributing to data integrity and regulatory compliance in the financial domain.
## Key Features:
1. **Preprocessing and Feature Extraction:** Developed pipelines for cleaning and standardizing financial text data, ensuring quality and relevance for anomaly detection. It utilizes advanced NLP techniques to extract meaningful features like relationships from the text.
2. **Dataset Collection and Utilization:** We gathered a diverse dataset of financial reports from Kaggle for training and testing the models, ensuring model adaptability by exposing them to a wide range of financial text data.
3. **Performance Evaluation:** We generates a detailed performance evaluation report using key metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. It compares the developed models against baseline methods to showcase their effectiveness in detecting anomalies.
4. **Validation and Qualitative Analysis:** We validates model generalization capabilities through cross-validation methods, ensuring consistent performance. It conducts qualitative analysis to gain deeper insights into detected anomalies and the system's ability to capture irregularities.
